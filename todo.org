*** TODO Fix unnecessary spacing
    [2020-01-21 Tue]
I think only bare elements need to have spacing, so elements can be
parsed/rendered without whitespace, but bare words need to be spaced.

** TODO Resource Definition
   [2020-01-21 Tue]
I feel like resources defined with URLs are out of date.  But
unfortunately the WWW demands them as that's how we connect sites
together.  So, at the bare minimum, we need a publishing mechanism to
make a resource permanent on a particular server.
** TODO Preserve casing in html templates
